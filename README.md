## Description

In this project we were supposeded to create a password login and authorization for the project that 
we have been working on all term. This is supposed to be implimented in both websiite and api in order 
to acieve what we want. The website.py uses flask-login and flask-WTForms. 

## Note
not very much on this works, sorry I tried but I could not figure it out.
I made the templates in website that are displayed for the login, sometimes the password and 
username combinations work and you are able to be registered but the majority of the time it just 
breaks. Login doesn't work -i assume- I wasn't able to test it much as I couldn't register users. 

I am sorry for a dissapointing showing on my last project. I really enjoyed this class and learned
a lot so thank you for a fun term!!
